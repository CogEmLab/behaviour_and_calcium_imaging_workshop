In other words, the large-scale background model used for CNMF is not sufficient for most 1p data. Hence, Pengcheng Zhou and others came up with a localized model of background activity for CNMFE: the background at each pixel is represented as the weighted sum of activity from a circle (or ring) of pixels a certain distance from that pixel. The distance of this ring from the reference pixel is set by the <em>ring_size_factor</em> parameter. This more complex pixel-by-pixel background model explains why CNMFE is computationally more expensive than CNMF, and also why it works better to mop up large-scale localized background noise in  1p data. \n",

This mean centering creates a Gaussian with a positive peak in the middle of width <i>approximately</i> <em>gSig/2</em>, surrounded by a negative trench, and a ledge of zeros around the outer edges.

The PNR is the ratio of the maximum magnitude at a pixel to the noise value at that pixel (it is a fast and rough measure of signal-to-noise).
